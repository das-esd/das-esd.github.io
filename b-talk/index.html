                          A business infrastructure plan creates a road map that is used to start and run a company. This road map consists of a three part plan: daily operations, processes, and employees. Each component of the business infrastructure should be created and analyzed independently of the others. The plan should act as a stand-alone resource for the way the business is to grow and progress well into the future.

                          If we consider our intelligence to develop generations with more psychologically, socially and spiritually active beings, then the definition of betterment can be considered valid. Imagination exists in time to build the future and hope. The only bad thing within good is that how you define bad. Consider good without limits, little bad is good.
                          <br><br>
                          Somehow, science has achieved its path towards perfection, now if 'Man' is made, the instinct of intelligence should be diverted towards multi-planetary or in search of stones, and no harm for the land and lives. Your betterment, like GDP, where the currency is the happiness. And happiness comes from a specific perception. #perception #betterment #future #hope

                          <b style="font-weight:400;">How to Find and Groom Your Successor</b><br>
                          <br>
                          One of the responsibilities that can be difficult, even for great CEOs, is to make the time to consider their successor plan. While it's human nature not to think too far into the future, you owe it to your organization to groom prime talent to replace you, regardless of how invincible you still feel. Think of it as a contingency plan.
                          <br><br>
                          Great organizations build successor plans deep into their organization as well. The idea is that if a lower-level manager wants a promotion, they'd better have someone ready to take over for them.
                          <br><br>
                          But, for this article, let's focus on what it means to put a successor plan in place for the top job: the CEO.
                          <br><br>
                          𝟭. 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀
                          <br><br>
                          In every organization, you have high-potential A-caliber players who are eminently promotable. These are people who check many boxes when it comes to attributes like intellectual capability, expertise, and ambition. These are the kinds of people you want to consider taking part in your successor plan. Nothing against solid B-players, but you're looking for your superstars when it comes to identifying the next potential CEO.
                          <br><br>
                          As you do your assessments, don't overlook how important it is that someone truly has the ambition to grab the top job someday. For instance, I remember early in my career, when I thought all my colleagues wanted to run the business, as I did eventually. But that wasn't true. Most people want to do their job and get a raise or promotion occasionally. They don't want the stress or responsibility of running the business. Many people might say they want the top job, but the percentage of people ready to do hard work and make sacrifices to get there is relatively small.
                          <br><br>
                          𝟮. 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁
                          <br><br>
                          How you structure the talent in your organization is an essential aspect of building your successor plan. Ideally, it would be best to have your high-potential leaders reporting directly to the CEO--which serves as a development platform for them. As CEO, you might have eight VPs reporting to you, for instance. That means you have eight slots available for future leadership candidates.
                          <br><br>
                          The catch is that a CEO can find themselves with direct reports who are fully capable lieutenants but lack one or more of the qualities that would make them a CEO successor candidate. While they might add value to the organization in their role, they also become blockers to the successor candidates beneath them.
                          <br><br>
                          This might force you to change your organizational structure, ranging from adding a new position that reports to the CEO or even replacing a B-player with an A-player on your successor list.
                          <br><br>
                          𝟯. 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗔-𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀
                          <br><br>
                          I've written before about how to develop A-players. It becomes an integral part of the CEO's job to put potential successors in place and give them the kinds of opportunities they need to grow the skills they'll need if they become CEO. Here are a few strategies to consider putting in place:
                          <br><br>
                          Education. Many times, the limitation of an A-player is that they're strong in one area of the business--like finance or engineering--but lack exposure to other functional areas like operations. Look for ways to give your potential successors opportunities to gain a more holistic understanding and exposure to running the overall business.
                          Cross-functional teams. Look for opportunities for your high-potential players to lead cross-functional teams involved with challenging projects, like implementing an ERP system or integrating a new acquisition, that present opportunities to learn about aspects of the business they have yet to be exposed to.
                          Peer groups. Another excellent growth opportunity for future CEO candidates is to join a peer group specifically focused on successor development. These groups will typically involve CEOs and their successors, which creates excellent learning opportunities for your successor to learn from other CEOs as they seek to develop well-rounded and robust leadership skills. (Full disclosure: We run peer groups focused on this topic at the Inc. CEO Project.)
                          <br><br>
                          𝟰. 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘁
                          <br><br>
                          At some point in your successor development plan journey, you need to make perhaps your most difficult decision: to step down. Otherwise, you risk becoming the blocker yourself to the high-potential leaders you have developed. But even then, there is a risk to the organization when you choose the person to succeed you. We need only to look at one of the most high-profile successor plans of all time, when Jack Welch stepped aside at GE, to see what might unfold. It was long known that Welch had three candidates on his successor list. And when he finally decided to name his replacement, the other two immediately left the company to take CEO jobs elsewhere.
                          <br><br>
                          As you go about constructing your successor plans, consider both the upside that comes with developing future leaders as well as the potential costs if you find long-term growth opportunities for all your A-players.

                          In the B2B space especially, almost every provider is switching to a software as a service (SaaS) model, making competition tough and permanent. Kier Humphreys, experience director at Hallam, argues that SaaS companies need to go back to basics to stand out: develop a clear narrative of differentiation.
                          <br><br>
                          Software as a Service (Saas) needs to deliver two things: software and service. It’s easy to think of this as a capital-light way to access tooling, but as every provider moves to a SaaS model, the fight for share-of-wallet has moved from an annual beauty parade to an always-on-consideration.

                          Procurement decisions have added a dialled-up layer of emotion with service now front and center. If there’s one thing that can positively impact our emotions, it’s effective brand execution (something that 82% of B2B marketers agree they need to be more focused on).

                          Brand investment isn’t new or magical: Tesco’s Finest range isn’t objectively better than its standard in-house range, but you sure feel fancy buying and consuming it. The level of experience vastly increases the perception of value and quality.
                          <br><br>
                          You aren’t the only SaaS offering in your industry. Chances are, your pricing and feature set are comparable to the competition’s. What separates you is the narrative you build around your brand and your ability to demonstrate the features you offer and the life-changing productivity, efficiency and life hacks your model delivers.
                          <br><br>
                          What can you do to make sure your SaaS marketing stands out? Simple: truly impactful experiences, from the first second someone reaches your platform. Ensure first impressions stand the test of pricing, onboarding and contracts. Stand apart with cohesive and distinctive brand development and creative execution.
                          <br><br>
                          The total experience is what drives churn reduction, LTV and growth. It’s B2B, but you’re still dealing with humans. Brand doesn’t stop with the first impression; it’s perception, which exists in each micro-interaction from day one onward.

                          It’s easy to get caught in an echo chamber when thinking about brand. You can waste hours considering the exact language for a brand vision document, but copy for a website will be written in minutes. Worse still, hours can be spent on how many times the phrase ‘digital transformation’ can be peppered throughout your homepage copy.
                          <br><br>
                          Brand has become a way to make your service more complex through language, rather than a perception built on promise and delivery. While it’s good that 50% of marketing budgets are allocated to branding in the most mature B2B brands, that often still focuses on the superficial.

                          Peep Laja (a hero in the conversion rate optimization space and founder of the message testing platform Wynter) recently posted on LinkedIn: “Your company home page is not where you should tell your narrative.” This should be printed out and stuck to the wall of every brand.
                          <br><br>
                          When we talk about dialling up your brand, it doesn‘t mean beating people around the head with the journey your founder took from humble goat farmer to hustling rockstar in the SaaS space. These narratives very quickly sound the same. Buyers (humans) don‘t operate in a vacuum. They don‘t view their interaction with you as epics to rival Lawrence of Arabia, ending up on your team page and marvelling at the collective genius that makes transformation simple through technology.

                          Every SaaS brand exists in a competitive marketplace, and every brand wants to stand out. It‘s easier to sell the idea of standing out by looking and sounding different. But what if you stand out by setting up a market-orientated solution and ensuring every touchpoint meets or exceeds buyers’ expectations?
                          <br><br>
                          Successful brands do the thing they said they would. If you aren‘t doing that, that beautiful font and pattern are as useful as Elon Musk‘s humility coach.
                          <br><br>
                          Where should this brand reset begin? Start small. Talk to your prospects. Have new employees review the competitive landscape. See how those most important to you perceive the brand you‘ve created. Talk to new and long-term customers and see if there’s any cohesion between initial promise and the reality of existing within your ecosystem. Improve both, and never stop.
                          <br><br>
                          Investing in your brand is more than just improving the look of your site and saturating the colors in your palette to deliver distinction. It‘s about providing a reality as close as possible to the perception you work so hard to project at the beginning of the association. Think of it as a new relationship: if the first date is you at your best, and every date after that slowly reveals the gremlin inside of you... you get the picture.
                          <br><br>
                          Constantly focus on your brand, and fixate on ensuring every touchpoint a customer or prospect reaches is as good as, if not better than, the first. Start with research; objectively audit your brand experience and focus on the areas causing customers and prospects the most pain. That, versus a new brand execution built on nothing but a desire for change, is the way to achieve sustainable growth.

                          Even the largest businesses have their roots in relatively humble beginnings. Amazon started off as an online bookstore, Tesco began life as a market stall, and KFC initially sold fried chicken from a single service station café in Kentucky.

                          Whatever their origins and no matter their scale, companies are required to deal with a number of events and obligations as they carve out a corporate path: from attracting the requisite funding, to dealing with the advances of a predatory rival.

                          Here are 10 corporate signposts each of which can have an impact on the portfolios of stocks and shares investors.

                          An initial public offering (IPO) is one way a company can ‘go public’ for the first time. This is when a company issues shares to the public in its bid to join the stock market.
                          <br><br>
                          A company carrying out an IPOs is also referred to as ‘floating’ on the stock market. UK flotations in the 1980s included the likes of BT, British Gas and British Airways.
                          <br><br>
                          From a company’s perspective, an IPO offers a way to raise money by selling shares in its business to willing investors. The number of shares issued, plus the price for which they sell, determines a company’s market capitalisation or ‘market cap’.
                          <br><br>
                          When undertaking an IPO, a company appoints advisers, most notably, an investment bank, which underwrites the deal. In other words, it offers guarantees about the number of shares being sold, taking up the slack if any remain unsold at the time of flotation.
                          <br><br>
                          Investment banks also look for would-be investors, set the offer price of the shares, and oversee the share sale.

                          Also known as a ‘reverse merger’ or a ‘reverse IPO’, a reverse takeover allows a private company to be listed on the market without having to organise and pay for an IPO.
                          <br><br>
                          Reverse takeovers occur when a private firm takes over a public firm where the latter is often a ‘shell’ corporation, in other words, an inactive entity or one with few assets. The private company ends up becoming publicly listed through the shell corporation.

                          Company report & accounts are a summary of a business’s financial activity over a 12-month period. In the UK, they are prepared for Companies House and HM Revenue & Customs every year and consist of items such as the ‘balance sheet’, ‘profit and loss statement’ and ‘cash flow statement’.
                          <br><br>
                          Each element provides an insight to shareholders and investors about how an organisation is performing. The larger the business, characterised by sub-companies, multiple divisions and various brands, the more complicated a company’s report and accounts will be.

                          Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) turn two companies into a single entity. Reasons for an M&A include teaming up with a rival, acquiring new assets, streamlining costs and encouraging innovation.
                          <br><br>
                          Whether the transaction is deemed a ‘merger’ or an ‘acquisition’ depends on factors including the deal structure, the size of the companies concerned and the markets that are affected.
                          <br><br>
                          M&As are categorised by type:
                          <br>
                          -- horizontal (for example, the merger of two competitors)
                          <br> -- vertical (where two different sorts of business combine to make stronger individual entity) and
                          <br>-- conglomerate (two unrelated companies combine but remain separate).
                          <br><br>
                          M&As are also categorised by form:
                          <br>
                          -- statutory<br>
                          -- subsidiary<br>
                          -- consolidation.
                          <br><br>
                          Mergers involve the combination of two equal companies resulting in a new entity under one name. Acquisitions tend to involve a smaller company being bought up by a larger one.
                          <br><br>
                          Depending on how an acquisition is structured, the smaller company might maintain its existing name and status or be absorbed into the acquiring company.
                          <br><br>
                          Mergers are voted on by boards of both companies and often require shareholder approval. Acquisitions may take place through more aggressive methods carried out by the acquiring company. Some acquisitions are described as ‘hostile takeovers’, where the acquisition of one company by another has taken place against the wishes of the former.
                          <br><br>
                          Depending on how it is viewed, an M&A can have a profound effect on a company’s share price. Shares in both companies may rise or fall depending on public opinion of the deal.
                          <br><br>
                          The conduct of takeovers and mergers of UK public companies is regulated by the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, usually shortened to the ‘City Code’.

                          A management buyout (MBO) involves a management combining resources to acquire all or part of the company. The idea is the management team takes full control and ownership of the business with a view to using their expertise to grow the organisation.
                          <br><br>
                          In considering an MBO, a number of considerations need to be applied, such as the desire and credibility of the management team putting in the bid, the availability of funding and whether all parties can agree upon the funding mix.
                          <br><br>
                          The hallmarks of a business that would facilitate a successful MBO are:
                          <br><br>
                          -- company with a track record of profitability<br>

                          -- strong and committed management team with a mix of skills<br>
                          -- vendor willing to consider sale to management<br>
                          -- deal structure that can be funded and supported by future cash flows<br>

                          Management buyins, or MBIs, are similar to MBOs but involve a management team from outside a company coming in to take control and ownership of an organisation. MBIs usually require external funding from banks or private equity investors.

                          A rights issue is a way for a quoted company to raise money. Instead of taking on debt, a business asks its existing shareholders to put their hands in their pockets to provide extra cash.
                          <br><br>
                          As part of a rights issue, a company gives its existing shareholders the right to subscribe to additional shares. Shareholders are not obliged to participate in a rights issue.
                          <br><br>
                          A 1-for-5 rights issue means an existing shareholder can buy one extra share for every five that are held. Every shareholder is offered the same deal, no matter how many shares they hold overall.

                          A stock split takes place when a company issues existing investors with additional shares for each stock that they already own. Each investor’s existing shareholding is ‘split’ into a larger number of shares, even though their overall holding in the company remains the same as before the split.
                          <br><br>
                          Companies split their shares to make each share in the business cheaper. In theory, this encourages more investment as the shares become more affordable.
                          <br><br>
                          A company might decide it needs to act because its share price has become too high either making it overbought (trading at a price above its intrinsic value), or expensive compared with other companies in the same industrial sector.
                          <br><br>
                          The most popular split ratio is 2-for-1 or 3-for-1. In these examples, a shareholder who owned one company share before the split, would end up with either two or three afterwards, respectively.
                          <br><br>
                          Earlier this month, the corporate giant Amazon executed a 20-for-1 stock split.

                          There are several reasons why listed companies are taken private.
                          <br><br>
                          Businesses often find it easier to restructure away from the rigours of being stock market-listed. Tough decisions on strategy, job cuts or governance do not have to be put to shareholders, nor is a private company required to report results every quarter.
                          <br><br>
                          Valuing private companies is much harder because there’s often a lack of information with regards to sales, profits and how a business’s products and services are performing.
                          <br><br>
                          When a business is taken private, the most obvious benefit to shareholders is that prospective buyers usually offer a price that’s above the company’s existing share price. According to the online broker AJ Bell, the average premium paid in both 2020 and 2021 for UK stocks was 37%, representing a healthy return for existing shareholders.

                          Once a company is taken private, it’s removed from the buying radar of retail investors – the likes of you and me. However, it’s not uncommon for a struggling company to be taken private, its problems fixed (with an injection of capital, for example) and then sold back into public ownership.
                          <br><br>
                          A ‘take private’ transaction might involve either one, or more, private equity firms acquiring the stock of a publicly traded corporation. Private equity is an alternative means of finance – distinct from taking out a loan, issuing stock or selling bonds – for a business that’s looking to raise capital.

                          Earlier this year, the Daily Mail’s owner, Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) exited the London market ending a 90-year history as a public company. DMGT was officially delisted from the London Stock Exchange following a successful privatisation by the Rothermere family.

                          A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a way of raising finance for a specific purpose, such as the acquisition of a third-party company.
                          <br><br>
                          SPACs are cash shells with no commercial operations or investments. They raise money from investors and list on a stock exchange before using those funds to buy a private business to take it public.
                          <br><br>
                          In the US in particular, SPACs – backed by movie stars, sports celebrities and politicians – have soared in popularity in recent years, with 248 companies going public in 2020 before being joined by another 630 in 2021.
                          <br><br>
                          Last year, after bowing to a clamour of pleas from entrepreneurs and investors keen to jump on the global SPACs bandwagon, the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial regulator, changed its rules to facilitate SPAC listings on the London stock market.
                          <br><br>
                          Despite several changes to the listing rules, UK regulations are regarded as more stringent compared with the US and other markets around the world. A concern remains about whether the existing framework is one that’s sufficiently flexible enough to allow SPACs to thrive domestically.
                          <br><br>
                          In the UK, a SPAC must raise at least £100 million in gross cash from public shareholders at the date of listing. ‘Public shareholders’ excludes directors, founders or anyone promoting the SPAC.

                          Strategy execution is commonly fraught with failure. Having worked with hundreds of organizations, we’ve observed one consistent misstep when leaders attempt to translate strategy into results: the failure to align strategy with the organization’s design.
                          <br><br>
                          Research suggests that only 10% of organizations are successful at aligning their strategy with their organization design. Some of the problem is a gross misunderstanding of what the word “alignment” actually means in this context. Most leaders naively assume that it means rigid processes that cascade goals from top to bottom, launching intense communication campaigns that promote top priorities, and shaping budgets to support those priorities. For example, one large manufacturing company we’ve observed invests countless hours every January having employees input goals that correspond to their boss’s goals into their HR system. But employees noted, “It’s all cosmetic. We write goals we have no idea if we can achieve, but as long as they appear linked to our boss’s goals, they get approved.”
                          <br><br>
                          The problem is that such processes leave alignment to individuals and ignore the systemic organizational factors needed to make strategy work.
                          <br><br>
                          An organization is nothing more than a living embodiment of a strategy. That means its “organizational hardware” (i.e., structures, processes, technologies, and governance) and its “organizational software” (i.e., values, norms, culture, leadership, and employee skills and aspirations) must be designed exclusively in the service of a specific strategy.
                          <br><br>
                          We recently saw this misstep play out with one of our clients — let’s call him Ivan — a division president of a technology company. Ivan was presenting his division strategy to the CEO, which included a plan to redesign his organization to align with their new strategy. The CEO curtly asked, “Why do you need to reorg?” Ivan had recently taken over the division and his predecessor had attempted a botched reorganization, so the CEO was understandably concerned about more churn. Ivan responded with: “Well, we have a new set of strategic pillars, including launching a new hardware product bundled with our software. We need an organization design that can deliver.” The CEO’s response was telling. He said, “You mean every time we change the strategy, we need to change the organization? Why can’t you just force alignment by tying everyone’s goals to the same outcomes?”
                          <br><br>
                          Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. When it comes to executing strategy, alignment means configuring all of the organization’s assets in the service of your stated strategy and making sure there is no confusion about what each part of the organization does to bring it to life.
                          <br><br>
                          If you’re embarking on executing your company’s strategy, here are six ways to make sure your organization is designed to do it successfully.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀.
                          <br><br>
                          A clear strategy ultimately differentiates you from your competitors. But to ensure that what sets you apart is more than a mere aspiration, you have to build the organizational capabilities needed to actually surpass your competitors.
                          <br><br>
                          Know what your current organization is and isn’t capable of and what capabilities you need to achieve the newly articulated strategy. Unlike competencies, which belong to individuals, capabilities are organizational. For example, innovation as an organization capability may result from integrating R&D, consumer analytics, marketing, and product development.
                          <br><br>
                          In Ivan’s case, he needed to build new capabilities that didn’t exist in his division, like product engineering, managing outsourced manufacturing, and new ways of going to market. The existing organization was largely designed to deliver software as a service, and had Ivan attempted to execute his strategy through that design, the new hardware product would have been marginalized.
                          <br><br>
                          Every strategy will demand unique competitive capabilities that clearly enable your success. This work that forms these capabilities is work you must be better at than competitors.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 “𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.”
                          <br><br>
                          Not all work is equal. True competitive work will get you $5 for every $1 you invest in it. However, “everyday work” — tasks that can be done on par with anyone else or in compliance with regulatory requirements, or even work that adds no value to the final product — must be resourced according to its strategic importance. Problems occur when your competitive and necessary work get too close or intermixed. In other words, the immediacy of everyday tasks takes away from the focus on competitive work.
                          <br><br>
                          This is especially challenging when the definitions of “everyday work” and “competitive work” change. In Ivan’s case, the role of product engineering had previously been focused solely on ensuring the division’s software could operate on various devices, and the team was buried two levels down within the engineering group. Because the division added its own hardware product, that everyday work became competitive work. To make sure it was competitively resourced, it needed to be elevated to the top of the division, separated from but closely linked to the software products, and staffed with top talent.
                          <br><br>

                          <br><br>
                          In the organizations we work with, governance design — which defines who gets to make decisions and allocate resources — is often too complicated or unclear to be effective. For a strategy to be successful, those closest to the most relevant information, budgets, and problems are the best equipped to make decisions. When leaders have proximity to an issue but no authority, authority without the needed resources, or control of the budget but not the people, the decisions tend to follow hierarchical lines. These decisions made at the top may be strategically sound but impossible to implement given how far away they’re made from those who must actually execute them.
                          <br><br>
                          Ivan recognized that for the division’s software and hardware offerings to remain equal in importance and integrated when necessary, he needed a cross-functional team expressly focused on just that. He knew that if everything escalated to his executive team, they would be regularly embroiled in the natural tensions arising from the new organization design.
                          <br><br>
                          So, he created a customer success council that included leaders from both product organizations, sales, customer analytics, and those managing the outsourced manufacturing. He empowered them to manage the strategic priorities, trade-offs, and potential conflicts across the organization. This ensured that critical decisions and resources were located with the cross-functional leaders best equipped to make them. This became especially important as sales people were quickly and successfully selling bundled offerings. Had this team not served as the air-traffic control of the deal flows and prioritization of client resources, it could have been a customer service disaster.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗦𝗵𝘂𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗶𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲.
                          <br><br>
                          The new governance is often no match for the legacy behaviors and processes that remain. Like layers of wallpaper in an old house, sometimes you need to strip down to the sheetrock to make way for new décor. Leaders must not only design new governance, they must also strip away previous processes and governance that are no longer contributing to the strategy’s success.
                          <br><br>
                          In Ivan’s case, his predecessor had set up several councils that had begun gaining momentum in the service of their old strategy. Those needed to be purged to ensure his new governance design could succeed without confusion or undue conflicts.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆.

                          We’ve all heard the cliché “culture eats strategy for breakfast,” but culture is just one ingredient that enables your strategy’s success. Understand the way your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors motivate other leaders to think, feel, and behave in similar ways. And whether you realize it or not, existing values may be rooted in a previous strategy. Consider an organization whose strategy is moving toward increased innovation and has a corporate value of precision. A value like precision could lead to over analyzing and a low tolerance for risk — the very things needed to encourage a more innovative culture.
                          <br><br>
                          Ivan’s company emphasized results orientation as a key tenet of its culture, but it often reinforced highly individualistic action at the expense of collaborative work. His new divisional design’s success was predicated on a substantial degree of cross-functional collaboration, so his executive team had a spirited debate about how to temper the individualistic interpretation of results orientation to ensure it didn’t undermine people’s ability to work in teams.
                          <br><br>
                          If you want your values to really matter, you must root them in all organizational decisions. For a company’s values to feel integral to the lifeblood of the organization, they must be visibly central to how the organization competes.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗶𝘃𝗼𝘁.
                          <br><br>
                          Too frequently, leaders assume that a few nips and tucks to the org chart are the equivalent of good design. But those are the Frankenstein “designs” that make people in different parts of the organization feel like they work in different companies. They quickly grow stagnant and are more fit for the PowerPoint slides on which they’re loosely drawn than for a dynamic business. For your structure to enable your strategy, it must be agile enough to face the shifts, challenges, and opportunities from its marketplace, stakeholders, and employees.
                          <br><br>
                          Nine months into his new design, several of Ivan’s strategic partners located in Ukraine were no longer able to provide the technical services they’d long delivered. Drawing on the expertise of leaders from across the division, the customer success team was able to quickly test and learn where they could make up for that loss of expertise. They identified multiple potential suppliers across the globe and made the decision to better distribute risk by contracting with four of them. Nimble structures allow for readily addressing these unforeseen challenges by making sure that coordination across the organization is easily achieved.
                          <br><br>
                          . . .
                          If you want to raise the odds of successfully executing your company’s strategy, invest the time in aligning your organization’s design to embody the strategy. Instead of relying exclusively on the alignment of goals and metrics, broaden your understanding of alignment to include all the components of your organization. Make sure they fit together congruently into a cohesive organization. You’ll signal to your people that you’re serious about the strategy and avoid the cynical eye-rolling that often accompanies the announcement of strategies that everyone knows can’t be executed.

                          Your workplace culture sets up the expectations and understandings of how your employees should think, act, and behave, and it is the number one way to attract and retain talent. Not only that, good workplace culture can help increase productivity and profitability. Many companies have defined culture through their values or a mission statement, but a true cultural statement should speak to what your company actually does to support its employees.
                          <br><br>
                          As we are in the era of the Great Realignment, right now is the prime time to either define your company’s cultural statement or redefine it based on the new status of our work world. Through a good analysis of your workplace culture, you can help improve your company in five key ways.
                          <br><br>
                          -- 1. UNDERSTAND YOUR LIVED-IN CULTURE VERSUS YOUR PERCEIVED CULTURE
                          <br><br>
                          A cultural analyzation is a test of your current culture that helps you identify areas of opportunity and weakness. In my experience, there is often a disconnect between what leadership thinks their company’s culture is versus what the employees’ view of the culture actually is. If leadership is unaware of a problem within their culture, they have no way to help rectify it.
                          <br><br>
                          According to the MIT Sloan Management Review, “a toxic corporate culture… is 10.4 times more powerful than compensation in predicting a company’s attrition rate compared with its industry.” Understanding where your issues are can help you know what areas need to improve for employees to have a more positive connection to the culture today and plan for a better culture tomorrow.
                          <br><br>
                          -- 2. IMPROVE COMMUNICATION
                          <br><br>
                          One thing you can learn through the analysis process is how the communications systems are working from department to department, employee to employee, leadership to employee, and employee to leadership and what can be improved. I have found that communication—and within it, the language used—is the No. 1 indication of how culture is performing.
                          <br><br>
                          A study in 2009 by WTW found that “Effective internal communications can keep employees engaged in the business and help companies retain key talent, provide consistent value to customers, and deliver superior financial performance to shareholders.” When you find systems that are broken or language being used that is counter to the culture you want to have, that becomes an area for immediate action. Using this information can help course-correct an entire culture when addressed properly.
                          <br><br>
                          -- 3. TURN INSIGHTS INTO ACTION
                          <br><br>
                          A challenge many leaders are facing right now is how to move past the deluge of information, opinions, and new strategies. A cultural analyzation can help you identify areas of weakness and opportunities, and then give you a narrative of what your future culture could be. The report can give you data to help back the decisions and show what the ROI and value on investment will be. Those future-led insights can then be brought back to the present with short-, mid-, and long-term goals to achieve that future cultural state. These become the metrics to monitor progress.
                          <br><br>
                          -- 4. FIND NEW AVENUES FOR PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AND LEARNING
                          <br><br>
                          Understanding how employees want to be recognized, what processes are in place that are considered a hindrance, and what skillsets employees want to further their career are all part of a cultural analyzation. The data from these components are used to create new roles within the company, develop new training modules, and allow for new and innovative ideas to flow.
                          <br><br>
                          Areas for upskilling and reskilling are often uncovered as part of the work going into the analysis, and these are two key areas for future workplace success. In my experience, most employees now cite the office as being a place for collaboration and learning versus standard routine work.
                          <br><br>
                          -- 5. CREATE A DEEPER LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT
                          <br><br>
                          Culture is about your employees’ experiences and actions. What you should want your culture to do is ultimately lead to happier employees who feel supported and know what their company stands for when it comes to how they are treated. Happier employees lead to more engaged employees, which ultimately can help the bottom line.
                          <br><br>
                          Companies that focus on improving their culture through a cultural analyzation often find more meaningful ways to engage with their employees, as the analysis process gives employees a voice to be able to state what they feel about the company, its culture, and their needs. It also can allow employees to voice what stagnant processes could be innovated or replaced. This effort can also help bring cross-collaboration between teams as they find common goals they want to work on.
                          <br><br>
                          A cultural analyzation allows for planned, future-led strategies that can improve your internal communications, help identify areas of process opportunity, establish what your culture should look like today and tomorrow, and make work more meaningful for everyone. This analyzation can create alignment to help you make more effective decisions for your future and give you actionable steps to work toward, and even show you what to avoid. In the end, it can help improve your employee experience, connection, and retention.

                        <p class="tm-text">-- In an increasingly uncertain world, leaders have to learn how to navigate simultaneous crises.
                          <br><br>
                          -- Excelling in turbulent times requires business leaders to prioritize, work at pace and provide a clear and compelling vision.
                          <br><br>
                          -- Leaders must be their own communications arm, delivering their message endlessly and consistently to ensure it is heard.
                          <br><br>
                          In today’s world, one thing is certain: uncertainty, a status that has emerged as the defining characteristic of our age.
                          <br><br>
                          For decades, much of the world enjoyed relatively steady economic and social gains. As a global collective, we have experienced better standards of living, improved transport and communication, improved civil liberties for more of the world than before, and improved life expectancies and public health. New technologies and a movement toward freer trade brought a record number of people into the global economy, creating expanded and robust economic flows.
                          <br><br>
                          But today, much of this economic logic is being upended. First, the pandemic and then the invasion of Ukraine presented the world with the most significant set of challenges since World War II. And now, in part on the back of these two crises but also driven by longer-term trends, the world faces strong headwinds, which will likely slow growth and create significant challenges for leaders around the globe.
                          <br><br>
                          Bold new approaches to productivity, supply, consumption and leisure are required – and are being adopted at surprising speed as an array of other disruptive forces accelerate and become increasingly apparent.
                          <br><br>
                          In this year’s AlixPartners Disruption Index, we identified four major trends that we believe will be most transformative in the years ahead.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗿𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀
                          <br><br>
                          1. 𝘋𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤 𝘥𝘦𝘤𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 – An ageing and decreasing population will impact all leading economies as labour force growth slows and, in many cases, shrinks.
                          <br><br>
                          2. 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘦𝘴 – Technological advancement is both a boon and a bane, becoming the principal driver of economic growth and improvements in quality of life while also being a primary source of disruption and dislocation.
                          <br><br>
                          3. 𝘋𝘦𝘨𝘭𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the latest step toward a more fractured world, as forces of deglobalization increase economic and geopolitical friction.
                          <br><br>
                          4. 𝘊𝘭𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦 – While the effects and urgency of global warming are becoming increasingly apparent and accepted, the transition to a clean energy future will likely take longer and cost more than many suggest.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗡𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲𝘀
                          <br><br>
                          But what happens when the entire planet is disrupted overnight?
                          <br><br>
                          As we saw with the pandemic and now with the war in Ukraine, predicting the next major global disruption is near impossible. However, preparing for and guiding others through an environment of uncertainty has become an essential leadership skill.
                          <br><br>
                          The best-performing companies disrupt and reinvent themselves on a continual and ongoing basis. And this is also true of those who lead them. Today’s leaders must have the courage to break away from tried-and-true but rapidly fraying business models, even when it feels hard.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗸𝗲𝘆
                          <br><br>
                          Prioritization means planning carefully and setting priorities with limited resources and then maintaining focus, measuring progress and ensuring accountabilities on these priorities. For many companies, rapid growth and accommodative financing in recent years have delayed many hard choices but a more difficult economic and financial environment will accelerate the need to focus.
                          <br><br>
                          General Electric’s decision to split itself into three pieces last year was a bold one. The decision was the natural endpoint of an extensive transformation project led by CEO Larry Culp, which included selling businesses, improving manufacturing processes and cutting debt. General Electric (GE) had to be broken down before it could be broken up. But the three-company solution was a clear win for both customers and shareholders.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
                          <br><br>
                          It’s impossible to overestimate the importance of execution. That is why it is important to take an action mindset – plan less and do more.
                          <br><br>
                          The time you have to drive value in business is often less than you anticipate and market volatility is currently at a high. Interest rates and inflationary pressures are rising as the pace of global growth slows. Ninety-four percent of executives believe their business models must change within the next three years. In order to make that transition, change has to begin today. The worst possible decision is to do nothing.
                          <br><br>
                          𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻
                          <br><br>
                          A broad group of stakeholders demand values-led leadership, which means being guided by a compass to do what is right rather than what is expedient or minimally necessary.
                          <br><br>
                          You must be your own chief communications officer, communicating clearly, regularly and consistently. Once leaders become tired of delivering their message, that is usually when a critical mass of stakeholders have heard it. Leadership, by definition, requires followership. If you’re not bringing others along on your journey – inspiring and guiding them – then any transformation is doomed to failure.
                          <br><br>
                          In a volatile environment, clarity, control and speed are essential. From our experience, leaders must lean into the forces of change, taking required and swift action before they lose the ability to set their own destiny. The macro-environment may not be in anyone’s control but you can direct how you respond and the rate at which you do so.

                          <b><em>Financial Advisor Vs. Financial Planner: What’s The Difference?</em></b>
                          <br><br>
                          Although the terms financial advisor and financial planner are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between these two types of professionals.
                          <br><br>
                          If you’re deciding between a financial advisor vs. a financial planner, here’s what you should know.
                          <br><br>
                          -- What Is a Financial Advisor?
                          <br><br>
                          A financial advisor has passed licensure and certification exams needed to provide guidance on investments and financial matters. Financial advisors can help clients with a variety of monetary decisions, including saving for retirement, buying a home or investing in a business. They can also arrange insurance coverage for clients and help strategize on estate planning—though you’ll still want an attorney to draft any wills or trusts.
                          <br><br>
                          <img class="zoomon" onclick="zoommit(this);" src="img/op-f.jpg"><br><br>
                          There are many different types of advisors, each offering their own set of strategies and services—as well as their own specialty. Most have passed certain licensing exams. This is typically the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 7 Exam or potentially the Series 65 Exam (required for registered investment advisors). Some financial advisors are also financial planners, though not all achieve this designation.
                          <br><br>
                          Financial advisors typically charge an annual fee for their services. Some also charge commissions on the products they sell, such as mutual funds and annuities. These fees can vary greatly, though annual fees often range from 0.5% to 1% of assets under management (AUM) with commissions as high as 6% of transaction amounts.
                          <br><br>
                          -- What Is a Financial Planner?
                          <br><br>
                          A financial planner is a special type of financial professional who leverages advanced knowledge and tools to create personalized financial plans for clients. These encompass everything from saving for retirement to arranging for late-life planning to strategizing on asset transfers.
                          <br><br>
                          Many financial advisory firms have one or more certified financial planners (CFPs) on staff to work with clients or advisors to prepare comprehensive plans for clients. These can then be used in conjunction with other tools and strategies to execute transactions and manage client finances.
                          <br><br>
                          Like financial advisors, financial planners often charge fees for their services. Depending on the specific services being provided, these fees may be monthly, quarterly, annual or project-based.
                          <br><br>
                          Some planners also earn commissions on the products they sell. Commissions are usually the same as for financial advisors, and hourly fees can range from $50 to $150 per hour (or at least $1,000 on a project basis).
                          <br><br>
                          -- Differences between Financial Advisor vs Financial Planner
                          <br><br>
                          While both financial advisors and financial planners work with clients and provide helpful advice, there are some key differences between the two. For example, while many financial advisors assist clients over a long period of time, some only help clients with specific transactions or investments.
                          <br><br>
                          Financial planners, on the other hand, tend to take a more holistic approach to client finances and develop long-term plans that address all aspects of a client’s financial life. These are usually revisited every few years, with client investments or strategies adjusted as plans are updated.
                          <br><br>
                          Another key difference is that financial advisors may earn commissions on some of the products they sell, while financial planners more commonly charge hourly or flat fees for their services.
                          <br><br>
                          Lastly, while financial advisors and planners often have many of the same licenses, they typically have different certifications—including the CFP designation.
                          <br><br>
                          -- When to Get a Financial Planner vs. an Advisor?
                          <br><br>
                          If you’re looking for help with your finances, both a financial advisor and a planner may be able to help you. The better option depends largely on your circumstances.
                          <br><br>
                          For example, if you have short-term issues or need assistance with specific questions or investments, a financial advisor can usually be a big help. However, if you want support for developing a comprehensive long-term plan for your finances, you may be better off working with a financial planner.
                          <br><br>
                          A financial planner might be the best fit if you:
                          <br><br>
                          - Want help developing a long-term financial plan<br>
                          -Want to gain a comprehensive understanding of how your finances are likely to evolve over the course of your life
                          <br> - Are going through a major life change, such as getting married or having a baby
                          <br> - Are nearing retirement and want to make sure you have enough saved
                          <br> - Need help managing debt, saving for college or creating a budget
                          <br>- Want to start strategizing about key asset transfers to heirs and other beneficiaries
                          <br><br>
                          Alternatively, a financial advisor may be more appropriate if you:
                          <br><br>
                          - Are looking for help with a specific investment strategy or decision
                          <br> - Don’t feel confident making financial decisions on your own
                          <br> - Have a comfortable financial situation and are simply looking for someone to provide occasional guidance
                          <br>- Already have a comprehensive financial planner and need someone else to help you use investments and other tools to execute your plan
                          <br><br>
                          -- How to Find a Financial Planner or Financial Advisor
                          <br><br>
                          If you’re interested in working with a financial planner or advisor, there are a few things to keep in mind. Follow these tips when choosing a financial advisor or planner to assist with your finances:
                          <br> - Pick someone who is licensed. Before you decide who to work with, check them out using FINRA’s BrokerCheck tool or the Investment. Advisor Public Disclosure database on the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) website.
                          <br> - Check the professional’s certifications. You can search for CFPs on the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards website.
                          <br><br>
                          Make sure they’re a good fit for your specific needs. Ask about their experience, investment philosophy and fees. Be sure to check references and read reviews before hiring someone.
                          <br>- Understand the relationship. Make sure you are clear on what services the financial planner or advisor will provide and how they will be compensated.
                          <br>- Know their limitations. Ask questions to ensure you understand the advisor or planner’s approach to managing money. Are there any strategies they can’t help with or products they aren’t able to offer?

                            <font color="#000000">In 2022, the average employee experienced 10 planned enterprise changes — such as a restructure to achieve efficiencies, a culture transformation to unlock new ways of working, or the replacement of a legacy tech system — up from two in 2016. While more change is coming, the workforce has hit a wall: A Gartner survey revealed that employees’ willingness to support enterprise change collapsed to just 43% in 2022, compared to 74% in 2016. Navigating the pandemic asked a lot of employees — and while they delivered, it came at a cost. Relentless sprinting means many employees are running on fumes. To create more sustainable change efforts, leaders must prioritize change initiatives, showing employees where to invest their energies. They also must manage change fatigue by building in periods of proactive rest, involving employees in change plans, and challenging managers to help build team resilience.</font>
